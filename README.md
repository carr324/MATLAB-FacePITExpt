MATLAB code for an experiment on faces and Pavlovian Instrumental Transfer:

This is MATLAB code for an experiment where the familiarity of male/female faces (obtained with permission from the [Chicago Face Database](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/bernd.wittenbrink/cfd/index.html)) was randomly varied through repetition, to gauge any effects on subsequent behavior reflecting [Pavlovian Instrumental Transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavlovian-instrumental_transfer).  The experiment was designed to run on Windows (so Mac's might have a few lingering compatibility issues), and the script requires [Psychtoolbox](http://psychtoolbox.org/) to be installed.  An example analysis script in MATLAB for this type of data is also included, in case it's helpful (any other questions regarding data/setup for this study, email Evan Carr at carr324@gmail.com).
